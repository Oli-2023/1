  <h2>my mom</h2>
  <p>She made Korean food for me and visited the Philadelphia Museum of Art, talked about it, and it was so meaningful for me.


  It was such a meaningful time because I didn't celebrate my birthday alone.
It was nice to spend it with my mom.</p>

  It was a good time because my parents came to eat Korean food and cook together.
